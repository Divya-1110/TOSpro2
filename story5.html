<h1><u>THE FOX AND THE STORK</u></h1>
<img src="fox.jpg" width=300px heigth=300px >
<p><font size=5px >O</font>ne day, a selfish fox invited a stork for dinner. Stork was very happy with the invitation – she reached the fox’s home on time and knocked at the door with her long beak. The fox took her to the dinner table and served some soup in<font color=mediumaquamarine>shallow bowls </font>for both of them. As the bowl was too shallow for the stork, she couldn’t have soup at all. But, the fox licked up his soup quickly.</p>
<p>
The stork was angry and upset, but she didn’t show her anger and behaved politely. To teach a lesson to the fox, she then invited him for dinner the next day. She too served soup, but this time the soup was served in two<i> tall narrow vases</i>. The stork devoured the soup from her vase, but the fox couldn’t drink any of it because of his narrow neck. The fox realised his mistake and went home famished.</p>
